Netlify CMS uses the [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow) + [Feature Branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). Additionally, PR's should be [rebased](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) on master when opened, and again before merging.

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch from `master`. If you're addressing a specific issue, prefix your branch name with the issue number.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Run `yarn test` and ensure the test suite passes.
6. Use `yarn format` to format and lint your code.
7. PR's must be rebased before merge (feel free to ask for help).
8. PR should be reviewed by two maintainers prior to merging.
